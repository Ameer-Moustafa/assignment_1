          Tyson Fury was forced to get up off the canvas as he claimed an
          incredibly controversial split decision victory over former UFC
          champion Francis Ngannou in Saudi Arabia.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ngannou, making his professional boxing debut, took Fury the distance
          and put his opponent on the canvas in round three after connecting
          with a left hook.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Fury, the WBC heavyweight champion of the world, was able to recover
          but ended the fight with a cut forehead, as well as a small mark
          underneath his left eye.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But while one judge scored it 95-94 in favour of the boxing novice
          Ngannou, two gave it to Fury at 96-93 and 95-94, preserving his
          undefeated record.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “That definitely wasn't in the script,” Fury said immediately
          afterwards. “Francis is a hell of a fighter, strong, a big puncher and
          a lot better boxer than we all thought he would ever be.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Fury’s victory means he will next face the WBA, IBF and WBO champion
          Oleksandr Usyk, with both men attempting to become the first
          heavyweight since Lennox Lewis to hold the undisputed championship.

          “That definitely wasn’t in the script,” Fury said afterwards. “He’s a
          hell of a figher and a hell of a lot better boxer than we thought he
          would be. He’s an awkward man and a good puncher and I respect him a
          lot.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “He was very awkward, he wasn’t coming forward and was waiting for me
          to throw. He’s given me one of my toughest fights of the last ten
          years.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about the knockdown he replies: “I was caught behind the
          head for the knockdown. I got back up and got back to my boxing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “I don’t know how close it was. I got the win and that’s what it is.”
        </p>

        <p>
          There has — somewhat predictably — been a very mixed reaction to Tyson
          Fury’s split decision victory. A lot of current and former
          professional boxers have argued Fury edged it. But just about every
          MMA fighter and analyst has said Francis Ngannou was robbed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The British former IBO super-middleweight world champion Chris Eubank
          Jnr. is one of those to have broken ranks. He scored the fight in
          Ngannou’s favour.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “Watching from ringside I thought Ngannou won the fight. It was close
          but he was the aggressor, landed heavier shots & scored a knockdown,”
          he wrote on Twitter.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “Fury deserved to lose after having so much trouble against a man who
          has never boxed before… too much time filming Netflix specials not
          enough time in the gym I’m guessing. Unlucky Francis.”
